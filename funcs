Readline fucns:

*** Function: void rl_redisplay (void)
    Change what's displayed on the screen to reflect the current contents of rl_line_buffer.

*** Function: void rl_replace_line (const char *text, int clear_undo)
    Replace the contents of rl_line_buffer with text. The point and mark are preserved, if possible. If clear_undo is non-zero, the undo list associated with the current line is cleared.

*** Function: int rl_on_new_line (void)
    Tell the update functions that we have moved onto a new (empty) line, usually after outputting a newline.

*** Function: void rl_clear_history (void)
    Clear the history list by deleting all of the entries, in the same manner as the History library's clear_history() function. This differs from clear_history because it frees private data Readline saves in the history list.
